# 🎬 Guess The Movie Game – Project Explanation

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a two-player Python game where players guess the name of a randomly selected movie.

Each movie is encoded using '*' symbols.
Players guess letters one by one.
If correct, letters are revealed.
If wrong, message is displayed.
Players can guess the full movie anytime.

## 🧠 Game Logic

### 1️⃣ Movie Selection
- Movies are stored in a list.
- A movie is selected randomly using:
  random.choice()

---

### 2️⃣ Encoding
- All letters are replaced with '*'
- Spaces remain unchanged

Example:
Movie: "taare zameen par"
Display: "***** ****** ***"

---

### 3️⃣ Letter Guessing
- Player enters a letter.
- If present → unlock positions
- If not → show "Letter not found"

---

### 4️⃣ Movie Guessing
- Player can attempt full movie guess.
- Correct → +1 point
- Wrong → continue guessing

---

### 5️⃣ Turn System
- turn % 2 == 0 → Player 1
- turn % 2 == 1 → Player 2

---

### 6️⃣ Ending Game
- If user selects Quit
- Final scores displayed
