MAGIC SQUARE: HIT AND TRIAL – SUMMARY

This discussion introduces the concept of a 3x3 Magic Square as a programming challenge.

A Magic Square is a grid where:
- Numbers are placed without repetition.
- Every row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same number.

For a 3x3 grid:
- Numbers used: 1 to 9 (each used exactly once)
- The required sum for each row, column, and diagonal is 15.

Example Solution:

4  9  2
3  5  7
8  1  6

Each row, column, and diagonal adds up to 15.

The challenge was first solved using a trial-and-error (brute force) approach:
1. Place numbers.
2. Check sums.
3. Rearrange if sums do not match.
4. Repeat until correct configuration is found.

Programming Approach:
- Use brute force.
- Generate all permutations of numbers 1–9.
- Check if the permutation satisfies magic square conditions.
- Print all valid solutions.

Key Discussion Points:

1. 2x2 Magic Square:
   - Try using numbers 1 to 4.
   - It is impossible to form a valid 2x2 magic square with distinct numbers.
   - No arrangement satisfies equal row, column, and diagonal sums.

2. 3x3 Magic Square:
   - Possible and well-known.
   - All solutions are rotations or reflections of one base solution.

3. 4x4 Magic Square:
   - Much more complex.
   - Brute force becomes computationally expensive.
   - Ordinary desktop systems may struggle due to factorial growth in permutations.

Important Concept:
The difficulty increases rapidly as grid size increases because:
- Total permutations grow factorially.
- 3x3 → 9! = 362,880 possibilities
- 4x4 → 16! = 20,922,789,888,000 possibilities

Conclusion:
- 2x2 Magic Square → Impossible
- 3x3 Magic Square → Possible and computationally manageable
- 4x4 Magic Square → Very complex due to combinatorial explosion

This problem is a classic example used to demonstrate:
- Brute force algorithms
- Permutations
- Constraint checking
- Computational complexity growth
