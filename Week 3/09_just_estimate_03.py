Topic: Manual Calculation of Trimmed Mean

Given:
75 estimates from participants.

Steps to calculate 10% Trimmed Mean manually:

1. Sort data in ascending order.
2. Calculate 10% of total observations.
   10% of 75 = 7.5 → take floor → 7
3. Remove:
   - 7 smallest values
   - 7 largest values
4. Compute average of remaining values.

Why Remove Extremes?

Extreme values (outliers) distort normal mean.
Trimmed mean provides more robust estimate.

Result:
Trimmed mean was much closer to actual value (375)
than simple mean.

Important Statistical Concepts:
- Sorting
- Outliers
- Mean vs Median
- Trimmed Mean
- Data aggregation
