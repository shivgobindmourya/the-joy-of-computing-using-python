THEORY OF EVOLUTION – BASIC SIMULATION CONCEPT

Evolution means gradual change in inheritable characteristics.

DNA contains information in binary form:
0 and 1

Mutation:
Randomly flipping a bit (0 → 1 or 1 → 0)

Over many generations,
random mutations accumulate.

This program simulates mutation using:

- Random index selection
- Probability-based flipping
- Iterative evolution

This is a simplified model inspired by genetic algorithms.
