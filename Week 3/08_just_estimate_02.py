JUST ESTIMATE – PART 02
Topic: Wisdom of the Crowd & Estimation Experiment

Experiment:
People were asked to estimate number of gems in a jar.

Actual number: 375

Observations:
- Some people underestimated (100, 150, 200...)
- Some people overestimated (1000, 1500, 2000...)

When combined:
Underestimation cancels Overestimation.

This produces a result close to actual value.

Historical Reference:
Francis Galton conducted a similar experiment
where people estimated weight of an ox.

Result:
Median estimate was extremely close to actual weight.

Key Insight:
Aggregation of independent estimates reduces error.

Statistical Measures Used:
- Mean (Average)
- Median
- Trimmed Mean
