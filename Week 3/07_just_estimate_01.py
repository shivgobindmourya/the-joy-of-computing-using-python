-------------------------------------------------------------------

SCENARIO:
A person remembered only partial information about a 90s Hindi song.
Google search failed because:
- No exact lyrics
- No tune
- No structured keywords

Solution:
The question was posted on Facebook.

Within minutes:
- Multiple people responded
- Some guesses were wrong
- One guess was correct

WHY DID THIS WORK?

Because of:
- Large number of participants
- Diverse knowledge
- Independent responses
- Collective intelligence

This phenomenon is called:

"WISDOM OF THE CROWD"

Definition:
The collective opinion of a large group of individuals
can be more accurate than that of a single expert.

Applications:
- Wikipedia
- Stack Exchange
- Quora
- Open Source Communities
